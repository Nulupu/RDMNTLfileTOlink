I did this telegram bot to gain more pussy. Pussy is never enough... when is not too much...


Telegram doesn't provide direct link to his files. So if you want to reproduce some telegram content on an external DAC/VLC or any MVP
you need an external streamable link. This link is generated on the fly from this bot. Quality is the same of the original file.
The bot accepts only link of mp3 files coming only from_chat_id telegram channel.
It doesn't copy/write the file anywere, the file is kept all in the memory of the server with a TTL of 2 hours




SET UP:
1) you need a hosting web service. Any with python support. I tested it with the free service of render.com

2) Set a .env file with the tokens, channel name and session name like this:

============================================
BOT_TOKEN=000000000000:AAAAAAbbbbbbbCCCCCCCddddddXXXXXXX
API_ID=123456789
API_HASH=aaaa123bbb456ccc789dddd
WEBHOOK_URL=https://yourhosting.service.pussy
SESSION_NAME=anysessionname
from_chat_id=TELEGRANCHANNELNAME
============================================

3) Once .env file is ready put it in the same folder of bot_streamer.py or in the settings of your hosting service.


Is basic, is scalable.
